#Background
This save manager was made for the following random reasons:

*I have an M.Sc in Computer Science but I've done little actual coding from the ground up; this was a bit of a hobby project
*Knowledge of and experience in C# and Visual Studio is of actual use in my day-to-day work
*I got bored of my simple powershell scripts that did almost the exact same thing as this tool, I wanted a GUI!
*EU4 starts are dynamic, and you want to get a good start for difficult achievements
*I like playing for achievements in EU4, I don't like the absurd amount of restarts and re-restarts some of them pretty much require
*I'm a father of a young kid and I have limited time to play EU4 so I'd rather use it effeciently
*You can also do the same things EU4ISM does by hand - the program just expedites the process
*Coding this and learning VS and C# was pretty fun actually
*The tool was released to public because it turned out OK and I thought I'd share it with other dirty savescummers

#Support & responsibility
*New and expanded features are unlikely
*I will probably fix any major issues if they appear
*Honestly, you can expect little to no support from me
*If it doesn't work, try running it with admin privileges
*This program is completely free and open source so you can modify and reuse it as much as you want
*By using this program you agree that I am not accountable for anything that happens to your saves, game files, computer, cat, mother-in-law or any other real or imagined object or being. Things can go wrong, you have been warned.
